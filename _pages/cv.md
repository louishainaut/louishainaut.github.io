### Other teaching

I taught the following week-long courses at summer schools of the [Quod Erat Demonstrandum e.V.](https://qed-verein.de/) (also see below under "Other"):

* 2021: _Geometric group theory_, with [Aras Ergus](https://aergus.net/).

## Other

* I have been a member of the [Quod Erat Demonstrandum e.V.](https://qed-verein.de/), a Bavarian math club for high school and university students, since 2011 and was its deputy chairman from 2013 to 2015.
I also functioned as an organizer for one of its seminars (in 2013) and one summer school/academy (in 2014).
Moreover, together with Aras Ergus and Leon Hendrian, I taught three courses at its summer school (in 2017, 2020, and 2021), see under "Teaching".
* I participated in the [ICFP Programming Contest](https://www.icfpconference.org/contest.html) as part of team udfew in 2015 and every year since 2017.
* In my high school years I participated in various German math competitions, with success at the federal state level.
