## Other

* Since 2011: I am member of the [Quod Erat Demonstrandum e.V.](https://qed-verein.de/), a Bavarian math club for high school and university students, and was its deputy chairman from 2013 to 2015.
I also functioned as an organizer for one of its seminars (in 2013) and one summer school/academy (in 2014).
Moreover, together with Aras Ergus and Leon Hendrian, I taught three courses at its summer school (in 2017, 2020, and 2021), see under "Teaching".
