**Short Bio**

Since September 2019 I have been working as a PhD student in Mathematics at Stockholm University under the supervision of Dan Petersen.

I obtained my Bachelor from EPFL in Lausanne in 2016 and completed my Master at ETH in ZÃ¼rich in 2018. My master thesis, written under the supervision of Peter Jossen, was concerned with proving the existence of resolutions of the group ring $\mathbb{Z}[G]$ with certain desirable properties.
