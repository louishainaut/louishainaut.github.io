I am a PhD student at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.su.se/department-of-mathematics/) of [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/english/), under the supervision of [Dan Petersen](https://www.su.se/english/profiles/dape3729-1.343293)

I am mainly interested in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry. More specifically, I focus on (ordered) configuration spaces and moduli spaces of curves.
