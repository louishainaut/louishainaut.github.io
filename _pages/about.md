I am a Postdoctoral scholar at the [University of Chicago](https://mathematics.uchicago.edu/), working in the group of [Benson Farb](https://mathematics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/benson-farb/). I did my PhD studies at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/department-of-mathematics/), under the supervision of [Dan Petersen](https://www.su.se/english/profiles/dape3729-1.343293)

I am mainly interested in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry. More specifically, I am working on (ordered) configuration spaces of graphs and surfaces, on moduli spaces of curves and handlebodies, and on certain properties of the polynomial outer functors on free groups.
