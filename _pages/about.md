I am a PhD student at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.su.se/department-of-mathematics/) of [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/english/).
My main supervisor is [Alexander Berglund](https://staff.math.su.se/alexb/) and my co-supervisor is [Greg Arone](https://www.su.se/english/profiles/graro-1.250967).

I am mainly interested in algebraic topology.
More specifically my focus has been on moduli spaces of high dimensional manifolds.
However I am also interested in functor calculus and have recently been working on the theory of operads and related structures.
